    <h1 class="marbot-2"><i class="fa fa-street-view"></i> &nbsp; Hey there! I'm Nick.</h1>

    <p>I guess that part is pretty obvious. What you may not know is that my favorite movie is Back to the Future; I listen to anything from classical to punk rock while I'm working; I don't like cantaloupe; I have been to the Phi Phi Islands in Thailand; I prefer red over white wine; and I live in a place where I see pileated woodpeckers on a regular basis.</p>

    <p>I've worked on the web for over fifteen years&ndash;I started off using tools like AOL page maker and now I focus heavily on user experience and interaction design for for large software projects in a variety of indsturies. I've written code in multiple languages including Javascript, HTML, CSS, Java, PHP, Visual Basic, ColdFusion and even COBOL.</p>

    <p>In my free time I'm usually out with my family taking walks, hiking, exploring nature. I draw and paint (not as often as I'd like), I take photos (sadly, <a href="http://nickcomito.vsco.co/grid/1" target="_blank">mostly with my phone</a>), or I'm just working on some project at home.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions about me, my work, whatever: <a href="mailto:nickcomito@gmail.com">please say hi</a>. I'd love to hear from you.</p>
