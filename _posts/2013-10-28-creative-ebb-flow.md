I consider myself an artist, but I guess it's always fuzzy. I'm introverted and sensitive, I pour a lot of emotion into my work and it often leaves me feeling drained. It's like I have a cup of water - as soon as the cup is empty it needs to be refilled.

Part of my growth and creative process has been learning to work with these changing energy levels. Sometimes I might be bursting with ideas, other times I might be totally drained. Part of my creative growth is certainly learning new techniques and improving my craft, but another part is accepting that creative energy levels are not always consistent and that's just part of the process. Learning new techniques and improving my craft have been just as essential as learning to take breaks, however long they require.

For me, being an artist means I'm a perfectionist. Being this way and realizing that I have to step away from work before it is finished is challenging. However, refusing to accept that the creative cup must be refilled is more detrimental to my work than stepping away. What Iâ€™ve found helpful is to stop everything I'm doing and listen.

Be still... Stop thinking...

When I do this, it increases my self-awareness and when that happens I'm able to listen to what my mind or body might need in that moment. Doing this is the quickest course to action if action is required - sometimes the mind simply needs rest, like a computer needing a reboot or a drain that needs to be unclogged.

So, for me, taking breaks is just as important to the creative process as the work itself. It's in the moments of not doing and not thinking that the work exposes itself. I love this aspect of what I do. Self-awareness is a wonderful skill to exercise - for me, it increases compassion and empathy which are vital for a designer.
