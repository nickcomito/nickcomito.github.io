Does this ever happen to you?

You're sitting at your desk working at your computer and you're in the groove, working on some project. You have a keyboard and a mouse at the ready. You're switching between the two frequently: typing, mousing, typing, mousing, typing... All of a sudden you go to grab your mouse, no wait! Your keyboard, no wait! Your mouse... system overload. Brain cannot compute. You just can't decide in that two seconds whether the mouse or keyboard will be faster. Then you laugh and hope this human glitch wasn't seen and/or is completely normal.

This just happened to me and I'm cracking up. Has it ever happened to you? Don't lie.
