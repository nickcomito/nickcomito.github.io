I consider myself to be a pretty shitty writer, but I enjoy writing so it's a start. For me, the problem is that writing doesn't come naturally to me like it does for others. I think I'm subconsciously trying to impress people which makes me write words and phrases I wouldn't normally use in day-to-day conversations. 

Smashing Magizine (I think it was Smashing) posted an article: [How to be a better writer, 6 tips](http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2014/11/how-to-be-a-better-writer/) on twitter a few months ago with tips on how to be a better writer which I found very helpful. It has tips like: "be conversational", "be visual", "talk to the audience as an equal" which I think are really helpful.

There's also something as simple as being vulnerable when writing and just practicing being in that uncomfortable state. It feels scary to write publicly so I think it's important to sit with that fear, that discomfort. This also helps me to be a better writer. This idea of accepting vulnerability gives me permission to just write and stop thinking about it so much.

Anyway, go check out that article. You can also listen [this podcast](http://www.onbeing.org/program/brene-brown-on-vulnerability/4928/audio) on the courage to be vulnerable.
