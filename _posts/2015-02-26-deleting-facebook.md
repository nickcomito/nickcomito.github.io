Things I noticed while deleting every Facebook post I ever made...

* I announced a website redesign many times
* The older I got the less I posted about controversial issues
* Friends tried to make plans with me but it usually didn't work out
* I used to post a lot lyrics that most people didn't recognize
* I used to care about politics
* In general, I posted less and less over time
* In general, and in retrospect, being on Facebook seemed like a waste of time
* Over time, Facebook became a negative experience for me
